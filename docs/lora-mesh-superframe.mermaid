    SF->>DT: Ordered node transmission/reception (per routing table)
    Note over DT: Nodes transmit/receive in pre-assigned slots<br/>Sleep when not scheduled
    DT->>DS: Network open for new nodes
    Note over DS: All nodes must listen<br/>Uses CSMA/CA to avoid collisions<br/>Limited number of slots
    DS->>CS: Network configuration
    Note over CS: All nodes must listen<br/>Slot requests processed<br/>Network manager role assignment<br/>Time synchronization
    CS->>NSF: Begin next superframe
