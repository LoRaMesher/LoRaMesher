## 1. Core Architecture Components

### 1.1 State Machine Framework üü¢ **Production Ready (95%)**

**Location**: `src/protocols/lora_mesh_protocol.cpp:379-450`

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:**
- Complete 6-state protocol architecture:
  ```cpp
  enum class ProtocolState {
      INITIALIZING,      // System startup and configuration
      DISCOVERY,         // Network detection or creation  
      JOINING,           // Connection to existing network
      NORMAL_OPERATION,  // Data transmission/reception
      NETWORK_MANAGER,   // Special coordination role
      FAULT_RECOVERY     // Connection loss handling
  };
  ```
- State transitions with proper guards and conditions
- Service coordination across state changes
- Automatic progression: `DISCOVERY ‚Üí JOINING ‚Üí NORMAL_OPERATION`
- State-specific message handling and timeouts

**üîÑ MINOR GAPS:**
- **Line 410**: Performance optimization needed - "TODO: Optimize this to avoid repeatedly checking state"
- No persistence of state across device restarts
- Configurable timeout values are hardcoded in some transitions

**Next Steps**: Add state persistence and make timeouts configurable via `ProtocolConfig`.

    uint8_t bestMetric = UINT8_MAX;
    uint16_t bestNextHop = 0;
    
    for (auto& route : routingTable) {
        if (route.destination == destination && route.hops < bestMetric) {
            bestMetric = route.hops;
            bestNextHop = route.nextHop;
        }

    // Handle sync drift
}
```

**Next Steps**: Make sync parameters configurable, implement drift compensation, add adaptive timing.
